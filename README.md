# PHP CPDF binary wrapper

PHP wrapper library for Coherant Graphics Ltd CPDF for easier integration into PHP projects without needing to install/build CPDF on the host machine.

> **IMPORTANT** CPDF binaries are released under a [special not-for-commercial-use license](https://github.com/coherentgraphics/cpdf-binaries/blob/master/LICENSE)
If you like the tools and want to use them commercially, or need support, licenses are available from
[Coherent Graphics Ltd](http://www.coherentpdf.com). Commercial use involves anything other than private, personal use.

Binaries are pulled from the official Coherant Graphics Ltd [PDF Command Line Tools binaries for Linux, Mac, Windows](https://github.com/coherentgraphics/cpdf-binaries) Github repository.

> **NOTE** Currently only Linux x86 binary driver is wrapped, the rest will come shortly :)
